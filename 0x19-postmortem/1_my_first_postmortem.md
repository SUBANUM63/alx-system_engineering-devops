# Description of the Diagram
## Issue Detected: Automated monitoring alerts identified high database load and slow response times.
Investigation by On-Call Engineer: Initial investigation by the on-call engineer assumed high traffic as the root cause.
## Actions Taken:
Scaled web servers to handle assumed high traffic.
Investigated server-side caching issues.
## Escalation:
Issue persisted, leading to escalation to the database team.
Root Cause Identification: Database team identified an unoptimized SQL query from the recent update as the root cause.
## Resolution:
Reverted the problematic update.
Restarted the database server to clear backlog operations.
### System Normalization: System performance returned to normal, resolving the outage.
Corrective Measures
### Optimize Existing Queries: Review and optimize all current database queries.
### Implement Code Review Process: Focus on database operations during code reviews.
### Conduct Load Testing: Simulate high traffic scenarios to assess performance impact.
### Enhance Monitoring and Alerts: Add granular alerts for database performance.
### Deploy Testing Environment: Set up a staging environment mirroring production.
### Update Indexing: Ensure proper indexing for all tables with complex queries.
### Refine Alerting System: Update the alerting system for earlier notification of performance issues.
### Documentation Update: Document the incident and update the runbook.

This flowchart provides a visual representation of the incident detection, investigation, resolution steps, and the corrective measures planned to prevent future occurrences.
